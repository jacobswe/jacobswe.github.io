# Hello! I'm Jacob

I am an AI Archictect and Data Scientist with years of experience in financial services, language modeling, and data science infrastructure management. In my free time, I like to experiment with voice-controlled smarthome automation, tinker with hardware (especially ESP32s), and spend way too much time rock climbing.

If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email. To see a more formal description of my experience and background, check out my resume. To hear more about what motivates me and what I'm currently interested in, checkout my About Me. Hopefully I'll start writing up some of my experiences both at work and in hobby on my Blog Posts, but there won't be much there for now.

Thanks for stopping by!
