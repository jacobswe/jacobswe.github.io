### **Hi, I'm Jacob.**

I'm an AI Architect, Data Scientist, and Software Engineer with a longstanding fascination for how things work. As a kid, this meant taking apart electronics and building DIY projects (like a custom navigation system for a sailboat!). Today, it translates into a passion for building intelligent systems, especially in the areas of language modeling, autonomous agents, and machine learning.

Currently, I lead AI projects focused on:

* **Agent Design:** Creating intelligent agents that can interact with their environment and dynamically perform complex [system-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) tasks.
* **AI Strategy:** Developing long-term AI roadmaps and implementation plans, setting architectural standards and fostering contribution ecosystems.
* **AI Education:**  Leading initiatives to demonstrate the value of AI across diverse areas within financial services.

Beyond the professional realm, I enjoy exploring the world of AI through personal projects, including:

* **Smart Home Automation:**  Building an LLM-focused voice-controlled smart home ecosystem with HomeAssistant.
* **Local AI:** Experimenting with on-device compute using ESP32 microcontrollers, local network inference, and private AI.

When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can usually find me rock climbing, judging rock climbing competitions, or curled up with a good sci-fi novel.
